japanese
========

This is a simple python3 script that trains you on the Japanese kana. You can choose between all kana, just hiragana, or just katakana. Items you did not know are shown once you quit the program.

The script reads the .csv table in order to generate the quiz items and to generate the Romanji corresponding to the kana. On first usage, the content of the .csv table is saved in the directory where you run the script as a pickle file ("data.pickle"). Once this is done, the .csv table is no longer needed.
